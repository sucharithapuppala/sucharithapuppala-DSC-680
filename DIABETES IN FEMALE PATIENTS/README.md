#### DIABETES IN FEMALE PATIENTS

Diabetes is one of the biggest health problems that affect millions of people across the world. Uncontrolled diabetes can increase the risk of heart attack, cancer, kidney damage, blindness, and other illnesses. Researchers are motivated to create a Machine Learning methodology that can predict diabetes in the future. Exploiting Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA) is essential if healthcare professionals are able to identify diseases more effectively. In order to improve the medical diagnosis of diabetes this research explored and contrasts various MLA that can identify diabetes risk early.
The project mainly focuses on the Prediction of diabetes in female patients.
