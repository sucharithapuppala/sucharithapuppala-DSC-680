## WATER POTABILITY PREDICTION

Access to safe drinking-water is essential to health, a basic human right, and a component of effective policy for health protection. This is important as a health and development issue at a national, regional, and local level. In some regions, it has been shown that investments in water supply and sanitation can yield a net economic benefit, since the reductions in adverse health effects and health care costs outweigh the costs of undertaking the interventions.
Drinking water and staying hydrated is associated with a reduced incidence of urinary tract infections (UTIs), lower blood pressure, and heart disease. Therefore, drinking water is essential for good heart health.
Water is the most important nutrient for the body. It has many benefits for your health and helps to protect you from illness and disease. Water is also an essential part of a healthy lifestyle. 
The project mainly focuses on identifying the machine learning model that best fits in predicting the water quality.
