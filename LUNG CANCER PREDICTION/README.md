### LUNG CANCER PREDICTION

In this paper I have discussed about the exploratory data analysis of the Lung Cancer dataset collected from the kaggle.com.


Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in women and men, and it’s the leading cause of cancer death, according to the American Cancer Society. Lung cancer begins in the lung and is most common in people who smoke. People who are 65 or older are at the greatest risk for lung cancer, but in rare cases it may affect people younger than 45.


My Statistical/Hypothetical question is – Which age group of people are suffering with lung cancer and has the habit of smoking and alcohol consuming?
