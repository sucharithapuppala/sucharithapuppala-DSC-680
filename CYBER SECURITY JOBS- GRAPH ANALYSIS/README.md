## CYBER SECURITY JOBS- GRAPH ANALYSIS

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes. Cybersecurity is a term used to describe the process of preserving sensitive information on the internet and devices from attack, deletion, or illegal access. The cyber security goal is to provide a risk-free and secure environment in which data, networks, and devices can be protected from cyberattacks.It is a complex field, and many roles can be found within banks, retailers, e-tailers, healthcare, and government organizations. 
On the job, you can expect to safeguard an organization's files and network, install firewalls, create security plans, guard customer data, and monitor activity.

In this project I have used Matplotlib for the analysis of the dataset collected.
